The problem Kisaan Konnect solves :
The power of the distribution chains has made it almost impossible for agriculture to be profitable â€“ a fact that everyone knows.
Only by supporting and promoting direct sales to the consumer can the farmer enjoy the profit margins he deserves for his work.
One of the unique possibilities offered by KisaanKonnect is the same, where we provide a platform for farmers and end customers to meet. Through this platform, farmers can register themselves and their fresh products and customers buy them.
